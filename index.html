      <p>Today, let’s start with a quote and story.</p>
      <blockquote class="quote" onclick="toggleQuoteVisibility(this)">
        <p>“You’ve gotta dance like there’s nobody watching, Love like you’ll never be hurt, Sing like there’s nobody
          listening, And live like it’s heaven on earth.”</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>This quote has inspired me so much that I don’t have any words to explain it.</p>
      <p>In my college days, I was afraid of being judged by people. And to get out of my comfort zone, I started doing
        internships.</p>
      <p>There, I met a person who changed my thinking. She was skinny due to her hormonal issues. But she was one of
        the kindest people I ever met.</p>
      <p>While working with her, I noticed that she never judged people. Instead, she tried to understand them.</p>
      <p>One day, I asked her, “How come you’re never afraid of being judged by people? How come you handle it so
        easily?”</p>
